# Connectors

Connectors are configured to retrieve data from a specific provider.

## Information

|Section|Description|
|---|---|
| Credentials | This section must be configured with sensitive information such as API keys and secrets. These values are encrypted in our database and are only decrypted by workers responsible to retrieve data from the provider. |
| Configurations | These values are required for some providers e.g., domain, service ID, etc. |
| Filters | These values allow you to filter results to retrieve only a subset of data according to your business needs. |

## IP addresses

All requests performed by our workers to the providers are done from the following IP addresses:

- 13.50.65.161
- 16.16.53.42

When possible, we recommend to always limit access to API endpoints to only our worker IP addresses.
